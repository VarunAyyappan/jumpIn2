How to Solve the Problems:
1) First Stage Problems:
    y = a(x-h)^2 + k
    h = vertex x coordinate, k = vertex y coordinate
    Then solve for a by plugging in a non-vertex point.

2) Second Stage Problems:
    Same as first stage problems.

3) Third Stage Problems:
    Use first stage steps, then open up parentheses and simplify .

4) Challenge Problems:
    Use a system of equations to solve these.
